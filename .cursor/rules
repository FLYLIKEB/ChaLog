## Git Workflow

- Before commit/push: Check `docs/git-strategy.md` (branch naming, merge procedures)
- When modifying screens/routes: Check `docs/architecture.md` and update if needed
- Pre-commit checks: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `tsc --noEmit`
- Commit messages: Write in Korean (e.g., `feat: 노트 필터 기능 추가`, `fix: 인증 버그 수정`)

## Release Automation

- Full release: `scripts/full-release.sh "<commit-msg>" "<version-tag>" [feature/branch]`
  - Example: `scripts/full-release.sh "feat: add note filters" v0.5.0`
  - Process: test/lint → feature push → develop merge → release creation → main merge+tag → develop re-merge

## Quick Commit & Push ("ch" command)

When user types "ch" or "커밋", automatically execute:

1. Branch management: Check current branch → if `main`/`develop`, create `feature/*` branch based on changes
2. Change analysis: `git status` → group by feature (auth, notes, teas, components, config, etc.)
3. Feature-based commits: Stage each group → auto-generate Korean commit message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.) → commit
4. Push & summary: After all commits, push → provide branch/commit summary

## Quick Pull ("pl" command)

When user types "pl" or "풀", automatically execute:

1. Remote update: `git fetch --all --prune`
2. Current branch pull: `git pull origin <current-branch>`
3. Main branches pull: Update `main`, `develop` (checkout → pull → return)
4. Summary: Provide updated branches and changes summary

Note: Branch strategy reference: `docs/git-strategy.md`
