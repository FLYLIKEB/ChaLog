## Core Workflow

### Git Operations
- Commit messages: Korean format `<type>: <description>` (e.g., `feat: 노트 필터 기능 추가`)
- Pre-commit: Run `npm run lint` (if exists), `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test:run` (if exists)
  - If validation fails: Show errors, don't commit, suggest fixes
- Branch naming: Use `feature/*` pattern based on changed files
- Documentation: Auto-update README.md, docs/architecture.md when code changes
  - Triggers: New features, API changes, component changes, route/page changes, dependency changes

### PR Review Process
1. List unresolved reviews: `gh api graphql` to get review threads
2. Apply one by one: Fix → Commit → Resolve thread via GitHub API
3. Push once after all reviews resolved

### PR Creation
- Check branch is `feature/*` and pushed to remote
- Generate title from branch name, description from commits
- Use `gh pr create` if available, otherwise provide GitHub URL

## Code Style

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Functional components with hooks, `cn()` utility, shadcn/ui patterns
- Import alias: `@/` for `src/`, TypeScript strict types
- Components: `src/components/`, Pages: `src/pages/`

### Backend (NestJS)
- DI with `@Injectable()`, Controller → Service → Entity pattern
- DTOs for validation, NestJS exceptions for errors
- Modules: `backend/src/{module}/`

### Testing
- Frontend: Vitest + Testing Library (`*.test.tsx` in `__tests__/`)
- Backend: Jest (`*.spec.ts` alongside source)
- Pattern: Arrange → Act → Assert

## Scripts Reference

- Quick commit: `scripts/quick-commit.sh [branch] [message]`
- Full release: `scripts/full-release.sh "<msg>" "<tag>" [branch]`
- Database: `backend/scripts/start-ssh-tunnel.sh`, `check-database.sh`
- See `docs/SCRIPTS.md` for details

## File Management

- Migration scripts: Delete after successful execution
- Temporary docs: Already in `.gitignore`, delete when no longer needed
- Documentation: Reference `docs/` files (git-strategy.md, architecture.md, DATABASE.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_STYLE.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Error Handling

- Git conflicts: Stop, show files, ask user (never force merge/pull)
- Validation failures: Show errors, don't commit, suggest fixes
- Missing scripts: Check existence, provide manual alternatives
- Never force operations without user confirmation
